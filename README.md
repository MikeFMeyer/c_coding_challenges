# C Coding Challenges

This project consists of multiple programs. The purpose of writing these programs is to better my experience with c and to learn in the process.

## Installation:

To get started, clone the c_coding_challenges repo and go into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/mikefmeyer/c_coding_challenges
cd c_coding_challenges/
```

## Compiling the project:

This project uses my libft library, thus the library needs to be compiled before compiling any of the program.

### Making:

To compile the libft, you need to run the following commands:

```
cd libft/
make
```

### Compiling the spy program with libft.a

Run the following command to compile the program.

```
gcc [filename] libft.a
./a.out
```
